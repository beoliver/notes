# REPL driven development

We currently know how to start a REPL and how to create a jar so that we can run our final application. 

The Term "REPL driven development" is intended to capture the idea that the REPL (Read Eval Print Loop) plays a central role when developing programs. However, this **does not** mean that you will spend your time tying expressions directly into the REPL.

The term "REPL aided development" is also used.
